# 03-Text-Adventure
Assignment for game tech (C220)

On the off chance I don't complete the inventory or even if I do I wanna explain my thought process because the commented code may seem a bit wild. I had a hard time getting the user to pick up and add to their inventory. My idea originally was assigning the inventory to a simple integer like 0 and then if they pick up the item the inventory changes to 1. Then it evolved to making the inventory a list of strings and then removing the keycard(in this instance) from the rooms inventory then appending it to the player inventory. Then I went back to a count variable that goes up when the player enters the "INSPECT MED BAY" room. Inventory is a bit more difficult (or maybe it's not and I'm just dumb) mostly because this is an engine with reference to a json file rather than just the game coded in one python file. I do, after investigating the engine, understand most of the code in the engine and I hope my tinkering within the engine itself rather than just the json file shows this. I'd like to tinker with this more. Again, if the inventory happens to not be finished I will just unlock the captain's quarters for sake of progressing to the end. I guess you'll have the code so technically you can end the game immediately but whatever haha. 

Sorry for the paragraph. My goal in my free time is to get this down first in a basic text adventure and then hopefully translate that into creating or just adding to your engine. I guess that's not important for this assignment but I just felt like providing explanation. Hope you enjoyed!

# I have gone through the game and progressed in attempt to answer the questions asked of me from the peer review document. 
# It was very interesting and fun to experience the dialogue and explore the ship.

# I have answered the questions and subbmitted them seperatly into canvas.

#What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?

I found it interesting that in each room the player was able to inspect various items or locations, taking more away from the room than the initial face value of the description.

#What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?

I would enjoy attempting to include items in my own text adventure, as my classmate had done. I would hope to one day have a game similar to the one I have made, but with many times more rooms and items galore.

#What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?

As far as I am concerned, there isn't really anything that could be improved, when I tape into consideration the amount of coding knowledge we possess in this stage of the course and the limited requirements for the assignment. 

#What could have been clearer or better commented?

Potentially proofreading would have helped in some places, just some simple typos were here and there.

#Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?

Nothing was in this code that wasn't in mine. 

#Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?

Yes it does.

#What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?

The readme was very informative to the process, maybe giving the player more of a heads up about the verbs used in the game would have been nice.

#Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.

I enjoyed playing the game, I believe the story line that the player is thrown into is interesting and engaging. I could see this game being extrapolated over the term of our course in attempt to make it a more interactive game and sci-fi thriller.
