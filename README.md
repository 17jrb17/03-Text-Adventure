# 03-Text-Adventure
Assignment for game tech (C220)

On the off chance I don't complete the inventory or even if I do I wanna explain my thought process because the commented code may seem a bit wild. I had a hard time getting the user to pick up and add to their inventory. My idea originally was assigning the inventory to a simple integer like 0 and then if they pick up the item the inventory changes to 1. Then it evolved to making the inventory a list of strings and then removing the keycard(in this instance) from the rooms inventory then appending it to the player inventory. Then I went back to a count variable that goes up when the player enters the "INSPECT MED BAY" room. Inventory is a bit more difficult (or maybe it's not and I'm just dumb) mostly because this is an engine with reference to a json file rather than just the game coded in one python file. I do, after investigating the engine, understand most of the code in the engine and I hope my tinkering within the engine itself rather than just the json file shows this. I'd like to tinker with this more. Again, if the inventory happens to not be finished I will just unlock the captain's quarters for sake of progressing to the end. I guess you'll have the code so technically you can end the game immediately but whatever haha. 

Sorry for the paragraph. My goal in my free time is to get this down first in a basic text adventure and then hopefully translate that into creating or just adding to your engine. I guess that's not important for this assignment but I just felt like providing explanation. Hope you enjoyed!
